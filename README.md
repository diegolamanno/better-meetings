---

The project that's trying to make meetings more efficient, inclusive and fun!

Setup:

1. ensure you have a copy of `.env.build` in your local clone's root directory.
2. `yarn install``

usage:

- `yarn start` to run the app in hot-reload + a local instance of the lambdas (you will still need to ngrok them to Pusher)
- `now --target stating` to deploy to now.sh.
